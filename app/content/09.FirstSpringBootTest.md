# Goals

LetÂ´s explore some key concepts related to @Repositories

- present some history behind the terms used
- talk about @SpringBootTest, and what component tests are meant to test
- write some tests to illustrate how a CrudRepository<Movie, Long> works

## Evolving models

- MVC - Model - View - Controller (2000s)
- Spring MVC - Repository - Service - Controller (early 2010s)
- WebFlux (reactive) (late 2010s - now)

## Layered Technologies

You can think of these layers as sedimentation.

- databases have been around for quite some time
- JDBC was one of the first specifications with plain SQL
- JPA re-defined persistence in a broader sense
- Hibernate is one of the most popular ORM libraries
- Spring Data JPA defines standardized repository interfaces
- which can be finally used by our java app
