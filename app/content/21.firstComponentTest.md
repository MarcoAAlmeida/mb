# 21 Implement AnswerRoundDTO evaluate(Integer roundId, ChoiceEnum choice) and others
# 21 Write first Behavioral Test (Cucumber) - BDD

We have our basic endpoints in place: a Player can start or stop a Game, and provide answers.

The system keeps score, and games are ended when 3 mistakes are reached.

We are ready to write our fist behavioral test (Cucumber)

## Implement Controller and Service methods

### next/{roundId}

returns a 200 NextRoundDTO when the given round exists
returns a 422 instead, if there is no roundId


### game/over/{gameId}

returns a 200 GameOverDTO when the given gameId is finished
returns a 422 instead, if Game is still going on

### player/{playerId}/unfinishedGame

returns a 200 UnfinishedGameByPlayerDTO when there is an unfinished game for playerId
returns a 422 instead, if no unfinished game exists

### round/{roundId}/answer/{choiceEnum}

returns a 200 AnswerDTO when the game is still unfinished
returns a 422 GameOverDTO when the game is over
