# 19 - GameService start and stop

We implement the GameService start() and stop()

We actually run into problems with our movie queries, which demonstrate how unit tests are not appropriate for operations that require database access.


## How to write you repository

Three ways to write queries for the database

1. [Spring Data Repository Methods](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/jpa/query-methods.html)
2. [@Query annotation - JPA and native queries](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-data-jpa-query)
3. [Criteria API](https://www.baeldung.com/hibernate-criteria-queries)


[Advanced Spring Data JPA](https://spring.io/blog/2011/04/26/advanced-spring-data-jpa-specifications-and-querydsl/)



# 19.1 - Complete the tests Activity

Some tests are marked like this
```
    @Test
    public void WhenGameStop_GameOverDTOReturned() {
        // TODO : implement
    }
```

Please implement the tests.  You should use similar tests as a template.

Unit testing is purely a mechanical activity, so the more you practice, the better you get at it.

Please watch the first section of next chapter to get the ideas about [coverage](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/code-coverage).

From now on, weÂ´ll start paying attention to our test coverage indexes.


# 19.2 - Using Eclipse to build and debug project
