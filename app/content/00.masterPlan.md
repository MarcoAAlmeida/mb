# 09 First Spring Boot test



# 10 Import from OMDB API

We create our first [Feign](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-openfeign/docs/current/reference/html/) REST client to consume [OMDB API](https://www.omdbapi.com/)

Our first [Spring service](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/stereotype/Service.html) is called MovieService, and it has a method to load Movies by title

# 11 Using Mock Server

Our previous [@SpringBootTest](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/api/org/springframework/boot/test/context/SpringBootTest.html) MovieServiceTests still made actual calls to the API

We use [MockServer](https://www.mock-server.com/mock_server/running_mock_server.html) to decouple project build from any external access

# 12 First REST endpoint

We build the [POST REST endpoint](https://www.baeldung.com/rest-http-put-vs-post) movies/loadByTitle

Configuration is added to generate automatic swagger UI according to [OpenAPI](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0) standards

# 13 Extract Additional Info from OMDB

We implement remaining properties of Movies entity, and explore alternatives for automatic mapping to DTOs with Mapstruct.

In MovieService, we combine calls to OMDB endpoints (search and detail) in order to populate the database.

# 14 Build remaining Entities

After spending some time in Movie, we implement the remaining entities.

Explore entity relationships @OneToOne @OneToMany, and defined schema.sql and data.sql to pre-load database

# 15 Add Liquibase as Database Migration Tool

Introduce the concept of database migration tools with Liquibase

# 16 Modify loadByTitle endpoint to generate CSV files

# 17 Implement MovieService.findNewPair(usedPairs)

# 18 Draw Activity and State Machine Diagrams

# 19 Implement GameService.start()/stop() and corresponding endpoints

# 20 Implement RoundService.create() and RoundService.evaluate()

# 21 Write first Behavioral Test (Cucumber)
