# 09 First Spring Boot test



# 10 Import from OMDB API

We create our first [Feign](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-openfeign/docs/current/reference/html/) REST client to consume [OMDB API](https://www.omdbapi.com/)

Our first [Spring service](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/stereotype/Service.html) is called MovieService, and it has a method to load Movies by title

# 11 Using Mock Server

Our previous [@SpringBootTest](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/api/org/springframework/boot/test/context/SpringBootTest.html) MovieServiceTests still made actual calls to the API

We use [MockServer](https://www.mock-server.com/mock_server/running_mock_server.html) to decouple project build from any external access

# 12 First REST endpoint

We build the [POST REST endpoint](https://www.baeldung.com/rest-http-put-vs-post) movies/loadByTitle

Configuration is added to generate automatic swagger UI according to [OpenAPI](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0) standards

# 13 Extract Additional Info from OMDB

We implement remaining properties of Movies entity, and explore alternatives for automatic mapping to DTOs with Mapstruct.

In MovieService, we combine calls to OMDB endpoints (search and detail) in order to populate the database.

# 14 Build remaining Entities

After spending some time in Movie, we implement the remaining entities.

Explore entity relationships @OneToOne @OneToMany, and defined schema.sql and data.sql to preload database

# 15 Add Liquibase as Database Migration Tool

Introduced the concept of database migration tools with Liquibase

Example of Liquibase loadUpdateData to load CSV

# 16 Modify loadByTitle endpoint to generate CSV files

Modified loadByTitle endpoint, and renamed it to generateCSVByTitle(title)

Demonstrated how generated CSVs can be used to pre-populate database during app startup

There are two planned activities:
- fix a bug detected with "chainsaw" keyword
- to enhance the endpoint to cover OMDB pagination

# 17 Design Services & Endpoints

We design the major endpoints and services based on the Activity Diagram

We also introduce the first draft of a NUXT frontend.

A new planned activity to introduce plot among the attributes brought from OMDB.

# 18 Implement MovieService.findNewPair(usedPairs)

We use Spring Data PagingAndSortingRepository to create a MovieService.findRandom() to get a random movie from our database.

Then we use MovieService.findRandom() to implement a MovieService.findRandomPair()

And finally we write MovieService.findNewPair(Set<ReflexivePair> usedPairs)


# 19 Implement GameService.start()/stop() and corresponding endpoints

# 20 Implement RoundService.create() and RoundService.evaluate()

# 21 Write first Behavioral Test (Cucumber) - BDD

# 22 Spring Session
